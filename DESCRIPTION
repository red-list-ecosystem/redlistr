Description: A toolbox created by members of the International Union for
    Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Ecosystems Committee for
    Scientific Standards. Primarily, it is a set of tools suitable for
    calculating the metrics required for making assessments of species and
    ecosystems against the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and the
    IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and criteria. See the IUCN
    website for detailed guidelines, the criteria, publications and other
    information.
